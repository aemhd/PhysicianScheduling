A- Phase 1
Objective: 3-Shift scheduling for 2-weeks, in addition to considering the cover requirements for each shit/day.

* 20 Physicians (represented as letters A-T)

during all 7-days on the week.

* 14 Physicians (represented as letters A-N) 
* Scheduled: 24/14 coverage.
* Shifts: 2-shifts per-day for period of 2-weeks.
